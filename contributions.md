### Francesco Manzionna
#### Week 1 (26.03 - 09.04)
* Date: 08/04/2024
* https://github.com/orgs/sopra-fs24-group-19/projects/1?pane=issue&itemId=57052158
* https://github.com/orgs/sopra-fs24-group-19/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=57054747
* Implemented the BE US1, BE US2 as for the requirements.

#### Week 2 (09.04 - 16.04)
* GitHub issues worked on: #29, #32, #36
    * https://github.com/orgs/sopra-fs24-group-19/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=57052401
    * https://github.com/orgs/sopra-fs24-group-19/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=57052373
    * https://github.com/orgs/sopra-fs24-group-19/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=57052268
* Additional details:
I've implemented Create, Get, and Delete functions to manage user reviews. Initially, user objects included all reviews internally to minimize backend requests. However, due to a preference for dedicated services, I've set up a GET service at URI: /users/{userId}. I haven't yet implemented checks to prevent fraudulent reviews.
Additionally, I've structured the Applications table to facilitate an inner join between tasks and users, ensuring all user applications are consolidated in one dedicated table.

#### Week 3 (16.04 - 23.04)
* GitHub issues worked on: #33
    * https://github.com/orgs/sopra-fs24-group-19/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=57052337
* Additional details:
Research work to implement real-time collaborative document editing (to implement a todo list) focusing on WebSockets for live, bidirectional communication.

#### Week 4 (23.04 - 30.04)
* GitHub issues worked on: #57, #58
    * https://github.com/orgs/sopra-fs24-group-19/projects/1/views/4?pane=issue&itemId=61233390
    * https://github.com/orgs/sopra-fs24-group-19/projects/1/views/4?pane=issue&itemId=61233480
* Additional details:
Fixed minor functionalities such as deleting all applications when a user is selected as an helper.

#### Week 5 (31.04 - 07.05)
* GitHub issues worked on: #69, #70
    * https://github.com/orgs/sopra-fs24-group-19/projects/1/views/4?pane=issue&itemId=61903991
    * https://github.com/orgs/sopra-fs24-group-19/projects/1/views/4?pane=issue&itemId=61904035
* Additional details:
    * Several controls have been implemented to ensure the legitimacy of reviews and prevent fraudulent behavior:
        * A user can only review another user if they have previously collaborated on a task or assisted the other user in completing a task.
        * It is verified that after the completion of a task, a user can leave only one review for the other user.
        * It is not permitted for a user to review themselves, in order to prevent fraud.
    * Additionally, the Delete TODO endpoint has been redesigned: it now only accepts the ID of the todo and the token, enhancing security and clarity.
 
#### Week 6 (08.05 - 15.05)
* GitHub issues worked on: #31, #32 (both frontend)
    * https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-19/client-group19/issues/31
    * https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-19/client-group19/issues/32
* Additional details:
    * Enhancement of User Detail Page:
        * The user detail page has been updated to now display for each review the author, creation date, star rating, and comment. Additionally, clicking on the author's name of each review will display their profile. The SCSS has also been modified to make the appearance more visually appealing.
    * General frontend overhaul:
        * Fixed a bug that caused the server to crash; now, each GET request for updates is sent every two seconds instead of every millisecond.
        * Replaced hrefs with links for some redirections to leverage the single-page application concept of React, avoiding page reloads and making the application noticeably more responsive.
        * Attempted to fix the logo by changing the image path; it is not yet working in the deployed version, suspecting that the build file has not been correctly switched on Google Cloud.
        * Fixed the favicon, which was not being displayed correctly.
