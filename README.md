# Helping Hands - Reinventing Community Solidarity

In an age where technology dominates our lives, the sense of community in our neighborhoods has sadly diminished. It’s not uncommon today for people to not know the names of their neighbors, with greetings reduced to mere formalities. The Helping Hands project is born out of the necessity to revive that lost sense of community, reminiscent of the times of our parents and grandparents.

## Introduction

Helping Hands aims to recreate the cohesive and supportive neighborhood environment that once existed. A friendly neighbor can significantly simplify daily life, and that is precisely the objective of Helping Hands.

## About the App

Helping Hands is a web application designed to foster neighborly assistance and collaboration. Here’s how it works:

1. **Registration**: Users can sign up and create a profile.
2. **Posting Tasks**: Users can post requests for help with specific tasks, such as grocery shopping, pet sitting, or any other daily activities.
3. **Finding Tasks**: By entering their home address, users can view tasks nearby. This ensures that help is always close at hand.
4. **Choosing Tasks**: Users can select tasks that match their skills and preferences.
5. **Earning Coins**: Upon completing tasks, users earn symbolic coins. These coins incentivize helping others and can be used to post their own tasks.
6. **Community Feedback**: A review system ensures that the individuals offering help are trustworthy and competent.
7. **Leaderboard**: There is a leaderboard where you can see the most helpful people in the community, fostering a spirit of friendly competition and recognition.

## Vision

Our vision is to restore the neighborly spirit of mutual assistance and goodwill. In a world increasingly disconnected by technology, Helping Hands aims to bring people together, fostering a community where everyone looks out for one another.

## Conclusion

Helping Hands is more than just an app; it’s a movement to rekindle the sense of community and solidarity that seems to have faded in our modern world. Join us in making neighborhoods friendlier and more supportive places to live. Together, we can make a difference, one helping hand at a time.
